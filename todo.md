# TODO

## Circles
  - cones
    - disable dragging and/or make sure dragging respects placement rules
  - centered on self circle
    - disable dragging and/or make sure dragging respects placement rules
    - register for token's movement and update position
    - if "centered on self" selected, pop up modal saying you'll have to update the placment from the Item's details page with confirm/cancel
  - ~~centered on target~~
    - ~~don't show template unless cursor is over a token~~
    - until I find a spell that actually targets like this, not gonna do it

## Rays
- originate from caster
- originate from selection
- system default option

## Targets (might need a new template type...)
- rangefinding
- when cursor over a token show the target ui
- when cursor over no token show the cancel icon

## General
- duration that ties into time passing like buffs do
  - alternately (or maybe as an interim option) add a checkbox to delete templates after spell is cast (clean up at end of round)

## Settings
- GM setting to allow alternate 15' cone
  - implement a way for regular and alternate 15' cone to coexist
- GM setting to turn off logging

## Lang
- externalize all strings

## Unknowns that I don't intend to look into
- Gridless
- Hex Grids
- Whether or not it runs on Forge
