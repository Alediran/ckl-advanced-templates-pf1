# TODO

## Circles
  - centered on self circle
    - disable dragging and/or make sure dragging respects placement rules
    - register for token's movement and update position
  - ~~centered on target~~
    - ~~don't show template unless cursor is over a token~~
    - until I find a spell that actually targets like this, not gonna do it

## Cones
- disable dragging and/or make sure dragging respects placement rules
- refactor menu to show radio buttons instead of just individual buttons (i.e. make it like the circle menu)
  - add a checkbox for "delete at turn end" like circle

## Rays
- originate from caster
- originate from selection
- system default option

## Targets (might need a new template type...)
- rangefinding
- when cursor over a token show the target ui
- when cursor over no token show the cancel icon

## Settings
- GM setting to allow alternate 15' cone
  - implement a way for regular and alternate 15' cone to coexist
- GM setting to turn off logging

## Lang
- externalize all strings

## Unknowns that I don't intend to look into
- Gridless
- Hex Grids
- Whether or not it runs on Forge
